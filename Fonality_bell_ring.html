<h1>Fonality Bell Prank</h1>
</div>
<p>
It started with the bell. I noticed that there was an unused Western Electric
remote telephone bell in my boss's office, just to the right of the door and
about two inches from the ceiling. I decided that I wanted to make it possible
for anyone in the company to make that bell ring by clicking a button on a
web page.</p>
<p>
I got the idea from a prank that one of my fraternity brothers had pulled on
the CEO of a company that he used to work for. The CEO had a habit of walking
around his office when he was thinking. He went on vacation and my friend put
a croaking frog in the ceiling with a motion sensor that would cause it to croak
when he walked. They also had it set up such that they could trigger it from
the office next door too.</p>
<p>
The company I worked for had a Christmas party and everyone was given a raffle
ticket and I happened to win several eBay gift cards. I won the eBay bid on a
Grandstream HT-386 dual FXS analog telephone adapter and used the gift cards to
pay for it. This device has an RJ45 Ethernet jack, two RJ11 jacks for analog
phones and a power connector. It is designed to obtain an IP address on the
network and then register as an extension with a SIP server and allow calls to
and from a dumb analog telephone plugged into one of the FXS ports. It can
supply enough power to make the remote telephone bell ring.</p>
<p>
Asterisk is software that can be installed on Linux and supports most SIP
devices, including the Grandstream HT-386. I had already installed Linux on my
laptop, so I installed a few additional packages: asterisk, apache and PHP.
Then it was a simple matter to modify the asterisk configuration files to allow
the HT-386 to register as extension 101 for one jack and 102 for the other with
a maximum ring time of 5 seconds, which is the length of time of one telephone
ring.</p>
<p>
Now the problem was how to cause asterisk to dial the extension from a web
page. One of the tools that a company engineer had written would cause a remote
customer system to dial an external number and connect the call to an extension
on their system when run from the admin server on the company network. So I
knew that there had to be a way to dial an extension too. After viewing the
source of the command that the engineer had written, I found out that what it
did was create a specially formatted file and copy it to
/var/spool/asterisk/outgoing on the remote system. I then created a file that
would cause extension 102 to call extension 101 with the 5 second timeout.
Then it was just a matter of writing an html/PHP file that would display a web
page and when the button image on the page was pressed, copy that file to the
/var/spool/asterisk/outgoing directory on my laptop.</p>
<p>
The next thing to be done was to run a wire from the bell in the office at work
to somewhere that I could plug the HT-386 into power and the network. The
company had added four cubes during an expansion and had hired electricians to
run network cables from these cubes to the network closet. They had cut holes
in the wall to run the cables down near the floor and another at the top of
the wall into the drop ceiling and the upper hole just happened to be less than
a foot from the bell. Only three of these cubes were in use, so there were
unused network and power jacks in the fourth cube. I brought in a spool of
telephone wire and one day stayed late until everyone else had gone home and
ran the wire up through the same hole that the network cables came out of near
the floor and through one of the mounting holes for the bell, connected it and
attached an RJ11 jack to the other end. Several days later, I brought the HT-386
into the office, hid it behind a box in Andy's cube and connected it to power,
the network and the bell.  I also connected a black RJ11 patch cable to the
connector on the side of the bell, lifted up one of the ceiling tiles and threw
the other end as far as I could. Then I powered on my laptop and made sure that
pushing the button on the web page would make the bell ring.</p>
<p>
The only thing left to do was to let everyone in the office except my boss,
Mike J, and his office mate, Dave, know about the web page. I just figured that
I would ask the engineering team if they had a mailing list tomorrow and send
out an email to the list during lunchtime.</p>
<p>
So the next day, I completed my first appointment for the day and went to talk
to the engineering team. I first talked to Carlo, but he told me to talk to
Greg, the manager of the engineering team, who insisted on me telling him what
I wanted the list for and as soon as I told him the web server IP address, he
pushed the button ten times. Then he asked what had happened. I told him that it
had made the bell ring. Since I had set it up to ring for 5 seconds, 10 pushes
of the button meant that the bell had rung constantly for 50 seconds. Ben and
Carlo, who worked for Greg went to Dave and Mike's office while Greg pushed
the button a few more times to verify that the bell was ringing. Then everyone
on the engineering team went to the web page and began pushing the button.</p>
<p>
After an hour or so of the bell ringing pretty much constantly, Mike said that
he was going to make sure that whoever had done this was going to be fired and
that he thought it was Carlo, because "he knows how to solder." The Human
Resources Manager then came around and was asking who did it, but nobody
confessed and Carlo just laughed and said "No, it wasn't me" when he asked him.</p>
<p>
After a while Ben came back to the engineering office and said that it was over
because Dave had unplugged the wire from the bell. I asked him which wire, and
he said the black one. I said that the black one was just a fake, a dummy one
that I had put in to throw them off. Ben's mouth dropped and everyone laughed
and continued pushing the button on the web page and ringing the bell.</p>
<p>
At one point the CEO, Chris came by to ask Mike something and Mike complained
about the bell to him and Chris just walked away in disgust.</p>
<p>
Dave then tried removing the metal bells, but while this made it much quieter
in the office, it didn't stop the bell from going "bzzzt" every time someone
pushed the button.</p>
<p>
After a while, Dave decided that even that was too much and got on his chair
holding a butter knife to cut the wires. We warned him that there was up to 90
volts on the wires and after looking at the butter knife, he decided to do it
anyway. He managed to break at least one of the wires and finally the bell
became silent.</p>
<p>
I went and asked Andy if I could get something next to the box under his desk
and removed the HT-386. I then shut down my laptop and put it and the HT-386
away in the laptop bag.</p>
<p>
In retrospect, I should have limited the bell to ringing only once every five
minutes instead of allowing it to ring constantly. This would have required
modifying the PHP script to create a time file and only allowing the
bell-ringing file to be copied if the time stamp on the time file was over five
minutes old and then touching the time file to update the time stamp. I also
should have created my own email list of everyone in the office to send the
email to. This may have resulted in me being fired that day, but if the CEO,
who has pulled his own pranks, had pushed the web page button a few times, he may
have prevented that.</p>
