Hello,
<p>
I used to do UNIX system administration in the Chicago area, but have moved to Santa Clara, California by way of Los Angeles. I like to read Science Fiction, but most of my books are in storage near Chicago. I may get them shipped out here someday.</p>
<p>
I recently didn't pay for my Zutronic(Go Daddy reseller) website,
named "LAComputerHelp.com".  Mainly because I got almost no work out of it
and ended up taking a full-time job near San Francisco.
I lost part of the IPCop IPSec VPN tutorial as I had only backed up the
first part and not the Sonicwall TZ170 and pfSense additions.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.clout.chi.il.us">"Clout Project"</a> was set up
to allow people who did not work for a large company or were not a student
at an Internet connected university to have access to Internet email.
I am one of the registrars of the chi.il.us domain that was set up to
support it.
Since anyone can now get a free Hotmail, Gmail or Yahoo account and
access it from almost any library, the
<a href="http://www.clout.chi.il.us">Clout Project</a> is pretty much
defunct at this time.
Although Jon Postel forbade us from charging any money when we were first
delegated the chi.il.us domain, Neustar, the current owner of the .us
registry is definitely trying to make money off of it.
Since we allied outselves with Uniforum Chicago, a non-profit group,
early on, we cannot charge for registrations and thus have no money.</p>
<p>
I think that <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> is a wonderful
service.
My actual cost per movie watched is down to about &#036;1.17 per movie.
Despite the Qwikster and price change gaffs, I still think that they are great!
Netflix and Redbox have forced Blockbuster into bankruptcy.
Blockbuster's long slow lines and late fees are a thing of the past for me.
